## EEC18 Digital System 

**Contextualization**
* Stated the prerequisite
* Learning Objective - Clear outline
* Slides A bit worded
* Intrigue student's interest

**Going into the Mathematical Algorithm**

**Computer Performs the Algorithm**
* Package the algorithm as a modular system.
* Asked students questions to derive the logical operation in the half-adder.
    * Covers the cost of a digital circuit.
* **Real digital circuit demo**
* Good homework
* Nice explanation on concatenating the half-adder.
* Great recap of what we just did.w

**Understanding** 
* Explain the base 10 algorithm with a circle

**Feedback**
* Show us the formula first with any arbitrary base 10 number
* Ask us more questions!
* The demo could have better presentation such as labels and more modularity.
* Like the excitement.
* Pretty engaging.
* Good intuition on adding negative numbers.

## EEC118 Digital Integrated Circuit

**Making the adder faster**
* Go into the NAND layout to justify for the propagation delay
* Give motivation on why we come up with the carry-bypass.
* Going over the boolean algebra but I need more time to process
* Nice overall picture that gives an overall picture of the carry-bypass.
* Result-Oriented
* Good explanation on the timing analysis of the parallel operation of the carry bypass adder
* Nice time complexity graph at the end to justify the need of the ripple carry adder.


**Feedback**
* Good explanation on the timing of ripple carry adder.
* Could be slower during derivation.
