# Digital Circuit

## Digital Circuit in CMOS

Why do we care?
1. **Delay** - Estimate and improve the circuit's performance.
2. **Die size** - Cost of the circuit.
3. **Power** - Estimate power consumption.

### Switch Model
* ON and OFF switches can represent boolean variables.
* Switch can build all digital logic gates.
* CMOS technology has the lowest power consumption.
* CMOS Scaling leads to lower cost, improved performance, and same power consumption.
